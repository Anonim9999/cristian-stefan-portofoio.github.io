# Description 
This corner does contain some of my active-projects as well as several future ideas and initiatives that I would like to engage with in the near future. 


# Junior Software Tester 

### Work Experience
1.Junior System Tester @Continental Automative Group
 # Project Name: ZCU - Zone Controller Unit 2025
- established the very first virtual testing entity (vECU) in cooperation with a team of newbies
- sucesfully harnesing the testing equipment resources as software labels and functions
- solve out over 68 bugs
- redesign and fixed up to 20 measurement software functions
  
2.Summer internship  @VNI(Vehicle netowrking) Departament Intern Continental AG
- acquiring knoweldge in software and hardware architecutre
- learning the ropes of debugging
- learning the fundamentals of Python and CAPL
- hands on experience with basis testing procedures (rooting and flashing)
  
3. Participant Cyber Tech Tournament, Sibiu(România)
- fully developed from scratch the hardware and software architectures of a line-follower robot
- reacehd the semi-finals phase

Summary: An exclusive competition for students in robotics, consisting of three stages (qualifiers, semifinals and
finals), aims to assist participants in developing various models of robots. These robots can range from simpler designs
like line followers or maze solvers to more sophisticated ones, such as cargo-carrying robots. The competition also
includes collective races to evaluate the robot's speed, efficiency and strength.
